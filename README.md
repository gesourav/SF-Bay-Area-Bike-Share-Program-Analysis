In this project I have explored the trips data from the Bay Area Bicycle Share program. I tried to get ideas about how the frequency of use varies across time and by which group of people. When are the number of trips increasing or decreasing across time? Can we find some patterns in the total number of bicycle trips according to the time of day or time of year? I have done a series of exploratory analysis to explore these questions.
